The contour plot shows percentage changes when the option is turned OFF\ncompared to the baseline (all options ON).\n\n**Panel C (Diurnal Cycle)**: Demonstrates how this effect varies throughout\na 24-hour period at a fixed location (45\u00b0N, 0\u00b0E, 300 km altitude).\n\n**Panel D (Seasonal Cycle)**: Shows how the strength of this effect\nvaries throughout the year, revealing seasonal dependencies.\n\n"
