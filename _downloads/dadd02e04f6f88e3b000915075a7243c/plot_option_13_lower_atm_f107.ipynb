This option represents a key\nphysical process that affects atmospheric density variations.\n\nUnderstanding how this option affects atmospheric structure is important for\natmospheric modeling, satellite operations, and space weather applications.\n"

The contour plot shows percentage changes when the option is turned OFF\ncompared to the baseline (all options ON).\n\n**Panel C (Diurnal Cycle)**: Demonstrates how this effect varies throughout\na 24-hour period at a fixed location (45\u00b0N, 0\u00b0E, 300 km altitude).\n\n**Panel D (Seasonal Cycle)**: Shows how the strength of this effect\nvaries throughout the year, revealing seasonal dependencies.\n\n"
