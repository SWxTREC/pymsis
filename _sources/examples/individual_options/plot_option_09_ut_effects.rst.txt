09. MSIS Option 9: All UT Effects
=================================

This example demonstrates the analysis of MSIS Option 9,
which controls Universal Time atmospheric dependencies. This option represents a key
physical process that affects atmospheric density variations.

Understanding how this option affects atmospheric structure is important for
atmospheric modeling, satellite operations, and space weather applications.

Option 9 controls Universal Time atmospheric dependencies
=========================================================

This atmospheric effect includes:

* Magnetic field orientation effects
* UT-dependent geomagnetic coupling
* Diurnal variation of magnetic field geometry
* Solar wind-magnetosphere interaction timing

This analysis shows how turning OFF this option affects atmospheric density
across different dimensions and conditions.

Understanding the Results
=========================

**Panel A (Altitude Profiles)**: Shows how this effect varies with altitude
and between different seasonal and diurnal conditions. Look for differences
between the four curves to understand temporal variability.

**Panel B (Geographic Map)**: Reveals the global pattern of this atmospheric
effect. The contour plot shows percentage changes when the option is turned OFF
compared to the baseline (all options ON).

**Panel C (Diurnal Cycle)**: Demonstrates how this effect varies throughout
a 24-hour period at a fixed location (45°N, 0°E, 300 km altitude).

**Panel D (Seasonal Cycle)**: Shows how the strength of this effect
varies throughout the year, revealing seasonal dependencies.

Physical Importance
===================

This atmospheric effect is important because:

* Important for geomagnetic coupling accuracy
* Essential for magnetic field orientation effects
* Critical for space weather applications
* Improves model accuracy during active conditions

When this option is turned OFF, these physical processes are removed
from the atmospheric model, which can significantly impact the accuracy
of density predictions depending on the specific application and conditions.
