Pymsis Documentation
====================

This is a lightweight Python wrapper around the MSIS00 and MSIS2 Fortran source code.
The `MSIS model <https://www.nrl.navy.mil/ssd/branches/7630/modeling-upper-atmosphere>`_ is
developed by the Naval Research Laboratory.

The :ref:`examples` are a good reference for quickly getting started with the Python code and demonstrate
how to call the models and plot the results. The explicit interfaces are described in the :ref:`api`.
