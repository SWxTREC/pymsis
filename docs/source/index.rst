Pymsis Documentation
====================

This is a lightweight Python wrapper around the MSIS00 and MSIS2 Fortran source code.
The `MSIS model <https://www.nrl.navy.mil/Our-Work/Areas-of-Research/Space-Science/>`_ is
developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. For quick access to the model data without any code,
there is a web viewer that uses pymsis: `<https://swx-trec.com/msis>`_.

The :ref:`examples` are a good reference for quickly getting started with the Python code and demonstrate
how to call the models and plot the results. The explicit interfaces are described in the :ref:`api`.
